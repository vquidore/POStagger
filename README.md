# POStagger
## Created by V Quidore and Nicholas Sugiarto

- This part-of-speech tagger implements a Hidden Markov Model to tag English sentences and phrases with 96% accuracy. The model is trained on the [Brown Corpus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Corpus) and on a simple data set of five sentences. Multiple versions of the corpus can be found [here](http://www.sls.hawaii.edu/bley-vroman/brown_corpus.html).
